# Deliverable 4


## Technologies

In terms of server hosting and cloud services, we will be using Docker and Render. Docker will host our Node.js and SQL server, while render will allow us to host these servers from a Docker Container on the cloud. 

For the front-end, general HTML and CSS will be used. Bootstrap will be a helpful tool with planning and blocking. 

On the back-end, MySQL will be used as our database, and Javascript will be used to mediate between the database and the front end. 

In addition, we will be using the API Supdata to scrape TikTok transcripts off of the web.
